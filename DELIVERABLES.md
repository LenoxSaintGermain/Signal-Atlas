# SIGNAL ATLAS — DELIVERY MANIFEST

## A) Executive Summary
The **Signal Atlas** is a "thinking instrument" for Third Signal, designed to move beyond the noise of AI hype. Unlike typical B2B marketing which relies on anxiety or jargon, this micro-app uses a **cinematic, high-status interface** to present 20 fundamental "Signals" of AI business transformation. 

The core value proposition is the **"Live Scenario"**: users select a signal, role, and industry, and a specialized LLM backend generates a bespoke, outcome-oriented vignette in real-time. This proves—rather than promises—Third Signal's capability to decode complexity. The architecture is stateless, scalable (Cloud Run), and integrates seamlessly into a Framer frontend, serving as a low-latency, high-impact brand asset.

## B) Framer UX Spec

**1. Grid State (Landing)**
- **Visual:** 4-column responsive grid (Desktop), 1-column (Mobile).
- **Element:** 20 "Signal Cards". 
- **Card Content:** Index (01–20) in monospace; Title (e.g., "PROBLEM GRAVITY") in bold editorial serif.
- **Interaction:** Hover triggers subtle scale/border shift. Tap triggers "Reveal State".

**2. Reveal State (Modal/Overlay)**
- **Transition:** Grid recedes (opacity 20%, blur 2px). Overlay zooms in gently.
- **Layout:** Split screen (Desktop). Left: Context. Right: Intelligence.
- **Left Column (Static):** Signal Title, "Truth" (one-line definition), Role/Industry Toggles.
- **Right Column (Dynamic):** 
  - *Loading:* Minimal pulse animation. Text: "Running Simulation..."
  - *Loaded:* Scenario Title -> Scenario Body -> Strategic Implication -> Outcome Anchors (Metrics) -> Connections.

**3. Controls**
- **Role Toggle:** Exec | Operator | Product.
- **Industry Toggle:** Auto | SaaS | Retail | etc.
- **Action:** "Shuffle Scenario" (regenerates prompt).

## C) Signals CMS Seed Content

| ID | Title | Truth |
|----|-------|-------|
| 01 | PROBLEM GRAVITY | The measurable capability of a specific problem to pull resources, attention, and urgency into its orbit naturally. |
| 02 | FRICTION INDEX | The drag coefficient of your organizational workflows; where velocity goes to die. |
| 03 | DECISION DENSITY | The volume of high-stakes choices required per unit of execution time. AI should lower this, not raise it. |
| 04 | TRUST SURFACE AREA | The exposure level where human intervention is mandatory to maintain stakeholder confidence. |
| 05 | LATENCY SENSITIVITY | The precise cost of delay. In some loops, speed is the only feature that matters. |
| 06 | CONTEXT DECAY | The rate at which information becomes irrelevant or toxic as it moves through the organization. |
| 07 | TOOL FRICTION | The cognitive load required to switch between the instruments of work. |
| 08 | HITL LOAD | The tax paid in human attention to correct, verify, or steer automated systems. |
| 09 | FAILURE VISIBILITY | How obvious it is when a system breaks. Silent failures are the highest risk. |
| 10 | STATE DRIFT | The divergence between the system’s map of reality and the territory itself. |
| 11 | OUTCOME BINDING | How tightly an AI initiative is coupled to a P&L result versus a vanity metric. |
| 12 | WORKFLOW INERTIA | The resistance of an existing process to being reshaped by intelligence. |
| 13 | KNOWLEDGE HALF-LIFE | The speed at which your proprietary insight becomes a commodity. |
| 14 | AGENT OWNERSHIP | Who owns the outcome when the agent acts? The defining legal boundary of the next decade. |
| 15 | INTEGRATION DEPTH | Is the AI a wrapper, or is it woven into the substrate of the business logic? |
| 16 | CAMPGROUND VS FACTORY | Are you building for safety and comfort, or for maximum explosive output? |
| 17 | SIGNAL-TO-NOISE | The ratio of actionable insight to raw data generated by your systems. |
| 18 | ADOPTION VELOCITY | The time it takes for a new capability to become the default way of working. |
| 19 | SECOND-BRAIN LEVERAGE | The multiplier effect of offloading memory and synthesis to external substrates. |
| 20 | OUTCOME COMPOUNDING | When one efficiency gain automatically triggers the next, creating a flywheel. |

## D) LLM Prompt + JSON Schema

**System Instruction:**
"You are a senior strategist who sells outcomes, not technology. You are precise, contrarian, and calm."

**User Prompt Template:**
```text
Context: You are the strategic engine for 'Third Signal', a high-status consultancy.
Task: Generate a business scenario for the signal "${signal_title}".
Signal Truth: "${truth}"
Target Audience: ${role} in the ${industry} industry.

Guidelines:
- Tone: Swiss editorial, cinematic, restrained, high-status. No sales hype. No buzzwords.
- Focus: Leverage, outcomes, and failure modes.
- Constraints: 
  - "compounds_with" must strictly be chosen from this list: [${all_signals}].
  - Do not include the current signal in "compounds_with".
  - Scenario should feel real, not generic. Use specific terminology relevant to ${industry}.
```

**Output Schema (JSON):**
(See `backend/app.js` or `services/geminiService.ts` for the exact Type definitions).

## G) Framer Integration Instructions

1. **Deploy Backend:**
   - Deploy the code in `backend/` to Google Cloud Run.
   - Note the URL (e.g., `https://signal-atlas-xyz.a.run.app`).
   - Ensure `API_KEY` is set in Cloud Run Env Vars.

2. **Framer Component:**
   - Create a "Code Override" or "Custom Component" in Framer.
   - Use the React code provided in `App.tsx` as the reference logic.
   - **Important:** Framer runs client-side. You will `fetch()` the Cloud Run URL.
   
3. **Fetching logic in Framer:**
   ```javascript
   const response = await fetch("https://signal-atlas-xyz.a.run.app/generate", {
     method: "POST",
     headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
     body: JSON.stringify({
       signal_id: signal.slug,
       signal_title: signal.title,
       truth: signal.truth,
       role: currentRole,
       industry: currentIndustry
     })
   });
   const data = await response.json();
   ```

4. **Styling:**
   - Use Framer's layout tools for the Grid.
   - Use the Custom Component only for the "Reveal" modal to handle the complex JSON rendering and state management.
